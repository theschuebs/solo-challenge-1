		<h2>A Diamond in the Rough...</h2>
			<p>I see potential everywhere. I see it in people, I see it in spaces, and I see it in furniture. I like to take lifeless, outdated pieces of furniture and create and design a fresh new function for the piece. Not only does reusing items keep them out of a landfill, but also can also be a money saver since new furniture can be expensive. </p>

			<h3> Project 1: Repurpose a dart board cabinet</h3>
			<p> This project is the result of needing a birthday present for my hard-to-shop-for dad. I decided his dart board could use a cabinet that had the crest from my grandfather's (his dad's) hometown in Germany. I bought a $5.00 cabinet from Goodwill, chalk paint, and some brushes.</p>

	<footer id="extra-content"> Check out <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/repurposed_furniture">Etsy</a> for repurposed furniture. On website inspection, it seems complex. I can see there are multiple style sheets set up, and other language (such as javaScript) integrated into the HTML structure. I can spot div and p tags as the main block level elements. </footer>
