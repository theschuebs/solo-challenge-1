	<h1>A Diamond in the Rough...</h1>
		<p>I see potential everywhere. I see it in people, I see it in spaces, and I see it in furniture. I like to take lifeless, outdated pieces of furniture and create and design a fresh new function for the piece. Not only does reusing items keep them out of a landfill, but also can also be a money saver since new furniture can be EXPENSIVE! </p>

		<h2> Project 1: Repurpose a dart board cabinet</h2>
		<p> This project is the result of needing a birthday present for my hard-to-shop-for dad. I decided his dart board could use a cabinet that had the crest from my grandfather's (his dad's) hometown in Germany. I bought a $5.00 cabinet from Goodwill, chalk paint, and some brushes.
