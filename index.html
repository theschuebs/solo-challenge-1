<h1>Making old furnature new again!</h1>
<p>I see potential everywhere. I see it in people, and I see it in spaces. I like to take lifeless pieces of furniture and create and design a fresh new function for the piece. Not only does reusing items keep them out of a landfill, but also can save $$ since new furniture can be EXPENSIVE! </p>
